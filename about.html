    I am a Computer Systems Engineering undergraduate at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. I am currently working on Udacity’s Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree, an online program developed with Mercedes-Benz, Nvidia, Otto and Didi. It’s the first program of its kind.

I blog about quantum computing, data analysis and occasionally share my thoughts here. In the spirit of continual learning I am pursuing an independent research project that focuses on Stack Overflow Data Dump Analysis. In my free time, I participate in online programming contests on HackerRank and LeetCode for fun. Also, I am an ACM student chapter member.

My long-term goal is to continue to learn and improve my developer skills. In addition, I aspire to be part of an amazing team creating world changing products sharing my technical and collaborative skills while discovering how engineering is applied to problem-solving in our rapidly changing high-tech world.
