<p>For the last few months, I've become a huge fan of the <strong>quiet weekend</strong>, <em>the weekend when no plan is the plan, and you are in no hurry at all.</em> I woke up on Saturday morning, and I decided that this weekend was going to be a quiet one.
After watching a late morning football game from the English Premier League -- yup, I refuse to call it soccer ðŸ˜€ -- I decided to write some code-nothing big, just a few lines of codes to improve my experience with Dash, a tool that I've been using for a few months. <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> is a MacOS application that offers offline documentation for hundreds of programming languages, fraweworks and libraries. Dash is awesome for offline programming when using spotty WiFi or on long-haul flights. While it is <strong>free as in beer</strong>, it's one of the programs that are worth paying for.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem">The Problem<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Problem"> </a></h2><p>I've been using Dash for quite some time and have been really satisfied with the preset selection of documentation sets. At some point, I started running into scenarios when I was using frameworks/libraries whose documentations aren't available for Dash. So, my objective was to generate documentation sets for these libraries myself.</p>
<h2 id="The-Solution:-Doc2dash-and-Sphinx-To-The-Rescue">The Solution: Doc2dash and Sphinx To The Rescue<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Solution:-Doc2dash-and-Sphinx-To-The-Rescue"> </a></h2><p><a href="https://doc2dash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">doc2dash</a> is a great tool for converting HTML documentation to Dash's format. doc2dash takes the output of Sphinx documentation and converts it to a Dash documentation package.</p>
<h3 id="Show-Me-The-Code!">Show Me The Code!<a class="anchor-link" href="#Show-Me-The-Code!"> </a></h3><p>In Just a few steps, I was able to build a docset for Zarr using dash2doc:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new conda environment and install dependencies</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ conda create -n dash-docs -c conda-forge <span class="se">\</span>
  doc2dash sphinx-rtd-theme numpydoc sphinx-issues
$ conda activate dash-docs
</pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Pull down the project form GitHub and build the documentation</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python.git
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> zarr-python
$ python -m pip install -e .
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> docs
$ make html
</pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Finally, run doc2dash with a few commands:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ doc2dash --name zarr --index-page index.html --enable-js <span class="se">\</span>
  --add-to-dash _build/html
</pre></div>
<p>And with that I had a shiny new Zarr docset in Dash:</p>

<p>Once I was confident that I understood how to do this for one project, I decided to automate this process for a bunch of other projects. By dinner time (on Saturday) I felt like I was on the right track. After a few more hours on Sunday and Monday, I had a <a href="https://github.com/andersy005/dash-docsets">GitHub repository</a> with continuous integration via CircleCI up and running, and had a dozen docsets generated:</p>

<p>Sitting in a chair in front a computer screen while listening to MIX 100 Denver Radio station ðŸ˜€, I was reminded of the intriguing parallels between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/science/math-physics-knitting-matsumoto.html">knitting and programming</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Knitting is Coding, and Yarn is a Programmable material."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>On quiet weekends like this I write code for fun, and Visual Studio Code &amp; Python are my yarn and needles.</em></p>
