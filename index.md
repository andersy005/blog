# Anderson Banihirwe

Currently, I am working as a software engineer in [Computational & Information Systems Lab (CISL)](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). On the interwebs, I go by [@andersy005](https://github.com/andersy005).

Iâ€™ve been extremely fortunate to work in realms that allow me to cross institutional and geographic boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. More generally I contribute to and maintain several libraries within the open source scientific Python stack, particularly around improving scalability of Python tools in order to (1) handle large scale datasets on [High Performance Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) and [Cloud Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) platforms and (2) move the [**open science paradigm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) forward.
