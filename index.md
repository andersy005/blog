# Anderson Banihirwe

Currently, I am working as a software engineer in Computational & Information Systems Lab (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

Iâ€™ve been extremely lucky to work in realms that allow me to cross institutional and geographic boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. More generally I contribute to and maintain several libraries within the open source scientific Python stack, particularly around improving scalability of Python tools in order to (1) handle terabyte to petabyte scale datasets on both High Performance Computing (HPC) and cloud platforms and (2) move science forward.

As part of my work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, I contribute to multiple open-source projects such as dask, xarray, jupyter, and intake. Most projects that I work on can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/andersy005).
