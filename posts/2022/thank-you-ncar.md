# Thank you, NCAR

TL;DR: three weeks ago, I left my employment at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://www.ncar.ucar.edu/). I started my new employment at [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org) two weeks ago.

## History

After a brief internship at [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) in the summer of 2018, I moved to Colorado to work for NCAR as a Software Engineer. At NCAR, my primary role was to contribute to and help maintain the software stack powering the [Pangeo Project](https://pangeo.io) -namely dask, xarray, intake, jupyter- as they pertain to NCAR systems and/or data.

## Thank you, NCAR
