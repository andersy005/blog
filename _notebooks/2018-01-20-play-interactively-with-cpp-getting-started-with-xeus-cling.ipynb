    "\n",
    "2. Familiarity with conda.\n",

    "To quote xeus-cling project:\n",
    ">It is preferable to install xeus-cling in a fresh conda environment. It is also needed to use a miniconda installation because with anaconda you can have a conflict with the zeromq library which is already installed with anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a start, we create a conda environment with all non-C++ dependencies and also install Jupyter Lab from conda-forge.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a new conda environment\n",
    "conda create -n xeus python=3.6 jupyterlab -c conda-forge\n",
    "source activate xeus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's install the actual interactive environment. For the C++ support, we install the interactive C++ compiler cling and the C++ kernel for Jupyter Notebook xeus-cling from the QuantStack channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install xeus-cling -c QuantStack -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After starting Jupyter Lab with jupyter lab, you should now see two additional kernels: xeus C++11 and xeus C++14. You can use either of them to use write interactive C++ programs.\n",
