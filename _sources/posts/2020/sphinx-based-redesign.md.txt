# Migrating from `fastpages` to sphinx-based blog

After a few months on [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/) hosted on GitHub pages, all the content I have published on my blog is now being built with sphinx hosted on Github pages. This sphinx-based redesign was inspired by [this blog post by Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/posts/2020/sphinx-blogging/). Thank you 🙏🏽, Chris!

The Sphinx source for this blog is hosted on Github in this [repo](https://github.com/andersy005/blog).
