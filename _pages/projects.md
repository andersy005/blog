I've been extremely lucky to work in realms that allow me to cross institutional and geographic boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. More generally I write open source tools for scientific computing in Python.

- [Intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm): this package makes it much easier for scientists to load cataloged Earth System Model data on an HPC system or in the cloud.

- [Pooch](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch): a Python package that manages downloading data files over HTTP and storing them in a local directory.

- [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html): a Python package for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.

- [Dask](https://dask.org/): a Python library for parallel computing.
