# About me

I work as a software engineer in the [Computational & Information Systems Lab (CISL)](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/).

As part of my work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, I contribute to multiple open-source projects such as dask, xarray, jupyter, and intake. Most projects that I work on can be found on my [{fa}`github,style=fab` GitHub page](https://github.com/andersy005).
