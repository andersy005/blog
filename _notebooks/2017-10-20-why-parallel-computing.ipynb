What if instead of behavioral research, scientists could use the models to study cognition, simulate and study disease, and learn from the ways of the brain—everything from how it uses energy to how memory, representation and even consciousness itself are constructed?"

    "Much of the tremendous increase in single processor performance has been driven by the ever-increasing density of transistors-the electronic switches-on integrated circuits. As the size of transistors decreases, their speed can be increased, and the overall speed of the integrated circuit can be increased. However, **as the speed of transistors increases, their power consumption also increases**. Most of this power is dissipated as heat, and when an integrated circuit gets too hot, it becomes unreliable. Therefore, it is becoming impossible to continue to increase the speed of integrated circuits. However, the increase in transistor density **can continue** at least for while. \n",
    "\n",
    "How then, can we exploit the continuing increase in transistor density? The answer is <font color='red'>parallelism</font>. Rather than building ever-faster, more complex, monolithic processors, the industry has decided to put multiple, relatively simple, complete processors on a single chip. Such integrated circuits are called **multicore** processors, and **core** has become synonymous with central processing unit, or CPU. "

    "There are a number of possible answers to this question, but most of them depend on the basic idea of **partitioning** the work to be done among the cores. There are two widely used approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Task-parallelism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_parallelism): is the simultaneous execution on multiple cores of many different functions across the same or different datasets.\n",
    "- [**Data-parallelism (aka SIMD)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism): is the simultaneous execution on multiple cores of the same function across the elements of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of global sum example [above](#Why-we-need-to-write-parallel-programs) would probably be considered and example of **data parallelism**. The data are the values computed by ```compute_next_value()```, and each core carries out roughly the same operations on its assigned elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this global sum example might be considered an example of **task parallelism**. There are two tasks: **receiving**, and **adding** the cores' partial sums, which is carried out by the master core, and giving the partial sum to the master core, which is carried out by the other cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both global sum examples, the coordination involves **communication**: one or more cores send their current partial sums to another one. The global sum examples should also involve coordination through **load balancing**: even though we didn't give explicit formulas, it is clear that we want the cores all to be assigned roughly the same number of values to compute. If, for example, one core has to compute most of the values, then the other cores will finish much sooner than the heavily loaded core, and their computational power will be wasted. \n",
    "\n",
    "A third type of coordination is **synchronization**. In most systems the cores are not automatically synchronized. Rather, each core works at its own pace. In this case, the problem is that we don't want the cores to race ahead and start computing their partial sums before the master is done initializing $x$ and making it available to other cores. That is, the cores need to wait before starting execution of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to add in a point of synchronization between the initialization of $x$ and the computation of the partial sums: ```synchronize_cores()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that each core will wait in the function ```synchronize_cores()``` until all the cores have entered the function--in particular, until the master core has entered this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the most powerful parallel programs are written using **explicit** parallel constructs, that is, they are written using extensions to languages such as C and C++. The complexity of modern cores often makes it necessary to use considerable care in writing the code that will be executed by a single core.\n"
