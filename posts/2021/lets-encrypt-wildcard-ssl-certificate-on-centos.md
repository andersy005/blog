# How to Generate Wildcard SSL Certificate using Letâ€™s Encrypt/Certbot on CentOS

Today I wanted to generate a wildcard SSL certificate for a service I was working on. Luckily, Let's Encrypt's ACME v2 production endpoint makes it so easy to generate wilcard certificates (for more details on this feature, see [this post](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-production-environment-wildcards/55578)). Below are the steps I used to generate a wildcard certificate.

:::{note}
This article describes the process for Centos 7/8 but can also be used for other Linux distros (with small changes in step 1). Also, `{subdomain}` and `{domain}` are placeholders. Remember to replace them with your own values. For instance, `{subdomain}`-> `mycloud`, and `{domain}` -> `example.com`
:::

## Step 1 â€” Installing the Certbot Letâ€™s Encrypt Client

```bash
$ sudo dfn install epel-release
$ sudo dfn install certbot
```

:::{note}

This step assumes that you are using CentOS 7/8.

## Step 2 â€” Obtaining a Wildcard Certificate

```bash
$ sudo certbot certonly -d *.{subdomain}.{domain} \
> --manual \
> --preferred-challenges dns \
> --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

The certbot prompts you for some personal information. Once everything is done, certbot provides a DNS TXT record to add to your DNS settings. At this point, head over to your DNS settings ( I was using google domains) and enter your TXT DNS record:

![google-domains-acme-challenge](../../_static/images/google-domains-acme-challenge.png)

:::{note}

`{subdomain}` and `{domain}` are placeholders. Remember to replace them with your own values. For instance, `{subdomain}`-> `mycloud`, and `{domain}` -> `example.com`

:::

At this point,

- Go back to your command line command (which should have been blocking after the DNS TXT record instructions).
- Then Hit `Enter`.

Cerbot will retrieve your DNS records to verify that the entries are correct. If the verification is successful, you get following output:

```console
Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.

Press Enter to Continue

Cleaning up challenges

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/mycloud.example.com/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/mycloud.example.com/privkey.pem
   Your certificate will expire on 2021-05-28. To obtain a new or
   tweaked version of this certificate in the future, simply run
   certbot again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your
   certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

## Step 3 â€” Testing the Certificate and SSL Configuration

At this point, you can ensure that Certbot created your SSL certificate correctly by using the [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) from the cloud security company Qualys.

Open your browser, and point it to the following link, replacing `mycloud.example.com` with your domain:

```console
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=mycloud.example.com
```

VoilÃ  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰!
