## About Me

My name is Anderson Banihirwe. Currently, I am working as a [software engineer](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/abanihi) in Computational & Information Systems Lab (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) while contributing to [Pangeo project's efforts](http://pangeo.io/).

I contribute to and maintain several libraries within the open source scientific Python stack, particularly around improving scalability of Python tools in order to handle petabyte-scale datasets on HPC and cloud platforms. Most projects that I work on can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/andersy005).



_I graduated from [University of Arkansas at Little Rock](http://ualr.edu/systemsengineering/) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering with a focus on Computer Systems._
