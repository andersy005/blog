<p>Imagine a particle of mass m, constrained to move along the x-axis, subject to some specified force $F(x,t)$.
<img src="../img/particle.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Classical Mechanics</strong> approaches this problem with the objective of determining the position of the particle at any given time $x(t)$. Once we know that, we can figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The velocity ($v=\frac{dx}{dt}$)</li>
<li>The momentum ($p=mv$)</li>
<li>The kinetic Energy($T=\frac{mv^2}{2}$)</li>
<li>Any other dynamical variable of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>We get $x(t)$ by applying Newton's second law: $F=ma$</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong> approaches the same problem quite differently. In this case we look for the particle's <em>wave function</em>, $\Psi (x,t)$ and we get it by solving one of the famous equation, the <strong>Schrödinger equation</strong>:
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial ^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2}+V\Psi$$</p>
<ul>
<li>i is the square root of -1</li>
<li>$\hbar$ is Planck's constant divide by $2\pi$</li>
</ul>
<p>The Schrödinger equation plays a role analogous to Newton's second law:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given suitable initial conditions (typically, $\Psi(x,0)$), the Schrödinger equation determines $\Psi(x,t)$ for all future time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Borns's statistical interpretation</strong> provides an answer to the question, " what exactly is the wave function and what does it do for you once you've got it?".</p>
<p>Born's statistical interpretation of the wave function says that $
 \left |\Psi(x,t)  \right |^2$ gives the <strong>probability</strong> of finding the particle at point $x$, at time $t$ or more precisely</p>
$$
 \left |\Psi(x,t)  \right |^2 = \begin{Bmatrix}
\text{probability of finding the particle 
between x and (x+dx) at time t}
\end{Bmatrix}$$<p>The statistical interpretation introduces a kind of <strong>indeterminacy</strong> into quantum mechanics, for even if you know everything the theory has to tell you about the particle, you cannot predict with certainty the outcome of a simple experiment to measure its position.</p>
<blockquote><p>All quantum mechanics has to offer is <strong>statistical information</strong> about the <strong>possible results</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Probability">Probability<a class="anchor-link" href="#Probability">&#182;</a></h1><p>Because of the statistical interpretation, probability plays a central role in quantum mechanics. The following section is a refresher on some of the common concepts used in probability/statistics.For more detail, I recommend <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-geometry/probability-basics/a/probability-the-basics">Khan Academy Course</a>.</p>
<h3 id="1.-Discrete-Variables">1. Discrete Variables<a class="anchor-link" href="#1.-Discrete-Variables">&#182;</a></h3><p>Discrete variables can take on only certain isolated values.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The sum of all posible outcomes</strong>
$$N=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty }N(j)$$</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Probability for each outcome</strong>
$$P(j)=\frac{N(j)}{N}$$</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Sum of all probabilities is one</strong>
$$\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}P(j) = 1$$</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The average value of $\left\langle j \right\rangle$</strong>
$$\left\langle j \right\rangle = \frac{\sum jN(j)}{N}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}jP(j)$$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In quantum mechanics the average is usually the quantity of interest; and it's also known as "<strong>the expectation value</strong>". It's a misleading term, since it suggests that this is the outcome you would be most likely to get if you made a single measurement(that would be the most probable  value, not the average value).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$$\left\langle j^2 \right\rangle = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}j^2P(j)$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>In general, the average value of some function of j is given by 
$$\left\langle f(j) \right\rangle = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}f(j)P(j)$$</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The variance</strong>
$$\sigma ^2 = \left\langle j^2 \right\rangle - \left\langle j \right\rangle ^2$$</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The standard deviation</strong>
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\left\langle j^2 \right\rangle - \left\langle j \right\rangle ^2}$$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.-Continuous-Variables">2. Continuous Variables<a class="anchor-link" href="#2.-Continuous-Variables">&#182;</a></h3><p>A continuous variable is the opposite of a discrete variable, which can only take on a certain number of values.</p>
<p>A few examples of continuous variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time it takes a computer to complete a task. You might think you can count it, but time is often rounded up to convenient intervals, like seconds or milliseconds. Time is actually a continuum: it could take 1.3 seconds or it could take 1.333333333333333… seconds.</li>
<li>A person’s weight. Someone could weigh 180 pounds, they could weigh 180.10 pounds or they could weigh 180.1110 pounds. The number of possibilities for weight are limitless.</li>
<li>Age. So, you’re 25 years-old. Are you sure? How about 25 years, 19 days and a millisecond or two? Like time, age can take on an infinite number of possibilities and so it’s a continuous variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some very important rules</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The probability that $x$ lies between $a$ and $b$ is given by 
$$P_{ab} = \int_{a}^{b} \rho(x)dx$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>$$1 = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\rho(x)dx$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>$$\left\langle x \right\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x\rho(x)dx$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>$$\left\langle f(x) \right\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)\rho(x)dx$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>$$\sigma ^2 = \left\langle x^2 \right\rangle - \left\langle x \right\rangle ^2$$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where $\rho(x)$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density </a></p>
<h1 id="Normalization">Normalization<a class="anchor-link" href="#Normalization">&#182;</a></h1>$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\left |\Psi(x,t)  \right |^2dx = 1$$<h1 id="The-Uncertainty-Principle-">The Uncertainty Principle <a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Uncertainty-Principle-">&#182;</a></h1><p>The position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrarily high precision. There is a minimum for the product of the uncertainties of these two measurements. There is likewise a minimum for the product of the uncertainties of the energy and time.</p>
<blockquote><p>The more precisely determined a particle's position is, the less precisely is its momentum <strong>$$\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a statement about the inaccuracy of measurement instruments, nor a reflection on the quality of experimental methods; it arises from the wave properties inherent in the quantum mechanical description of nature. Even with perfect instruments and technique, the uncertainty is inherent in the nature of things.</p>
